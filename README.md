Plugin that allows the cheshire cat to retrieve updated football data. This plugin is based on a football scraping library that I developed https://github.com/mmassime/Football-data-scraper, when this library will be updated with more functionalities I will also update the plugin. As of now it's possible to ask the cat for the current table of the league, the players of a team and the matches of a team.

Here is an example:
